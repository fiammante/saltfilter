OpenScad filter for full face snorkeling mask.

Making my full-face protection mask from a snorkel mask. 
Given the lack of masks, after reading “Universal and reusable virus deactivation system for respiratory protection” article on nature https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956 and “A biomedical engineer created a mask coated in salt that he says could neutralize viruses like the coronavirus in 5 minutes” on business insider https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/mask-coated-in-salt-neutralizes-viruses-like-coronavirus-2020-2, then seeing “European researchers retrofit snorkel masks for coronavirus fight” on Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-czech-snorkel-mask-idUSKBN21H2Z5 I decided to build reusable masks for me and my wife, better than nothing.
I bought a full face mask on amazon and replaced the snorkel by a 3d printed salt filter designed with Openscad https://www.openscad.org/.
This project contains the OpenScad parts.
If you have another mask the inletv.scad out outletv.scad should be changed to fit yours.

The parts to print are filter.scad for the filter itself and grid.scad for the 4 grid separation that maintain the high granularity salt in place.
