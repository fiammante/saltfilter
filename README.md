OpenScad filter for full face snorkeling mask.

Making my full-face protection mask from a snorkel mask. 
Given the lack of masks, after reading [“Universal and reusable virus deactivation system for respiratory protection” article on nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956) and [“A biomedical engineer created a mask coated in salt that he says could neutralize viruses like the coronavirus in 5 minutes” on business insider](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/mask-coated-in-salt-neutralizes-viruses-like-coronavirus-2020-2) , then seeing [“European researchers retrofit snorkel masks for coronavirus fight” on Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-czech-snorkel-mask-idUSKBN21H2Z5) I decided to build reusable masks for me and my wife, better than nothing.
I bought a full face mask on amazon and replaced the snorkel by a 3d printed salt filter designed with Openscad https://www.openscad.org/.
This project contains the OpenScad parts for this [masks I bought on Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07L8RH96N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
If you have another mask the inletv.scad out outletv.scad should be changed to fit yours.

The parts to print are filter.scad for the filter itself and grid.scad for the 4 grid separation that maintain the high granularity salt in place.

Given the lack of masks, after reading [&quot;Universal and reusable virus deactivation system for respiratory protection&quot;](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956) article on nature and [&quot;A biomedical engineer created a mask coated in salt that he says could neutralize viruses like the coronavirus in 5 minutes&quot;](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/mask-coated-in-salt-neutralizes-viruses-like-coronavirus-2020-2) on business insider, then seeing [&quot;European researchers retrofit snorkel masks for coronavirus fight&quot;](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-czech-snorkel-mask-idUSKBN21H2Z5) on Reuters I decided to build reusable masks for me and my wife, better than nothing.

Here are the steps that I followed

| 1/ I bought the following &quot;Speedsporting Full Face Snorkel Mask 180°&quot; on Amazon:
 | 2/ Remove the snorkel (one pin to remove) | 3/ View from top Air in and out flows. These snorkel masks separate with valves the air flow going in and going out. |

| 4/ Created a 3D model of a filter with separated inlet and outlet ![Image of Filter top](/images/topview.png)

| 5/ After few hours of printing ![Mask4](images/mask4.jpg) | 6/ Side view ![Mask5](images/mask5.jpgg) |

 |
 |
 |
| 7/ Insert the inner sliders
 ![Mask6](images/mask6.jpg) | 8/ Get dish washer salt, check it is regular salt (Na Cl). The reason being that salt is high grained and will let air flow between the grains. ![Mask7](images/mask7.jpg) |

| 8/ Cut out the support from the inner sliders to the outside |
